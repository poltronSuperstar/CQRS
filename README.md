# CQRS in Python

(this is a work in progress)

## What is it, why is it ?

There is a practice, in code, that is generally recognized as bad, called "reinvent the wheel".

Here are two advices I like to give about development:
* Know what are the bad practice, both in general and in the specific language you're using
* Reinvent the wheel

Reinventing the wheel is probably the best thing you can do to level up your code.
You just have to be aware when you may be doing it.

See, in my opinion, being good at code is not about knowing how to do thing the correct way,
rather, it's about knowing not to do them the wrong way. Knowing what is bad and build
an intuition about why it may be bad.

The way I like to do that is taking a subject, implementing it from scratch, avoiding 
as much as you can to read state of the art libs. Do some mistakes. Then only see how 
other dev are dealing with the subject.

In this case I need a CQRS dispatcher un Python. I know how to implement that in Java and C#.

But the Python implementation, (Python being duck-typed and lacking Interfaces) asks some questions 
I'm not sure I have the right answer for.

So, the repo is me playing with that. Don't use it, better libs doing exactly that probably exist out there.








But...

## Towards a V1

My goal is to eventually release something usable, with clean code pattern. If you want to help,
read PRs, give advices, I'd be very happy. Just be aware I'm in the "making mistakes" phase.
